            <p><b>11.	Find Users at the Beginning of their User Journey: </b>User journeys involve quite a few numbers of steps.

            <img src=" {% static 'images/image_3.jpg' %}" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            <p><b>15.	Meet Customer Expectations:</b>71% of consumers who are happy with the customer service they get via social media are likely to recommend that brand to others. Social media is one of the most effective and accessible places to solve your consumers’ problems. Not even problems, but through the comments, likes, shares, and saves that your posts receive you can have first-hand feedback. Through feedback, you can improve your user designs.

            <p><b>16.	Gather Real Time Data and Improve: </b>Social media earlier was very basic. It was difficult to track data or gather any insights. Fast forward to 5 years and we have well-defined dashboards for businesses/users to collect, modify, interpret, and analyze all the interactions that occur with their profile. When you gather data, it becomes easy to change certain things. The insights provided by Facebook and Instagram help you determine the KPIs, budget, design, etc for any upcoming ad campaigns.

            <img src=" {% static 'images/image_3.jpg' %}" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            <p><b>17.	Tell Your Brand Story: </b>Each advertisement that is displayed on huge banners or printed in national newspapers cost a fortune. The print media restricts you to pour your heart out. You can only select concise ad copies/captions that will promote your brand. And often because of this the brand’s mission statement is overshadowed with big ad captions. But social media has the power to communicate the actual brand story. You can put up innumerable posts highlighting your business’ journey, the idea that led to it, and what you seek to deliver in the future. Users love to read about the real story and get to know about the business they are going to associate themselves with. Stories, reels, feed, quizzes, etc everything can help you convey your brand/business mission. Consumers who connect to the authenticity of the business are more likely to stay a loyal customer throughout their user journey. Storytelling is one tactic that can come handy when you plan on sharing your brand story.</p>
            <p><b>18.	Drive Traffic to your Business Website: </b>Social media promotions can assist in landing customers directly to your site. Search engines cannot directly bring you customers or traffic to your site. To increase the potential reach of your business you need to spend some time on different platforms. Social media platforms are immense and user engagement is top-notch. Instead of relying completely on search engines, you can leverage various social media sites to get you traffic. Social media channels allow for numerous diverse traffic streams. Although social media channels can be monetized you need to make sure that the content is up to date and is posted at the time when a lot of users are present online. This can be determined by testing for initial time till you get a hand on it. Within your posts, try linking your business site so that people can directly visit you. The more convenient is the step the easier it is for people to search and reach out to your website.</p>
            <img src=" {% static 'images/image_3.jpg' %}" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            <p><b>19.	Link Building: </b> Link buIlding is all about spreading your content so that people can reach out to you. Consider that you posted an amazing article that got about 1000 shares. Now your followers who might be writing a similar article will put in a link so that people can drive back to your site. Now 1000 shares is a big number to achieve but aren’t impossible if your content is original and solid. Try creating original content on various social channels. This will lead to hundreds of backlinks. Do not focus on a single social media platform rather try to leverage each and every platform possible. This is one of the indirect advantages of using social media to advertise. Links help to build a community and spread the much-needed awareness about your business.</p>
            <p><b>20.	Time efficiency: </b> Time is said to be an expensive currency. When people decide to take their business online especially on social media, the one thing they misinterpret is the power and efforts it takes to market on social media. Social media marketing is one of the most efficient forms of advertising and can give you a great ROI only if you do it in a planned way. That’s the only reason the demand for social media marketers is increasing. You might be efficient at multi-tasking but the best way to get good returns of your efforts is to get it done through someone who is aware of the nuance of social media.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p> <b>Taking a look at the above advantages, social media marketing is going to be future of advertising, so this is the right time to take your business online and reach out thousands of potential people who might be searching exactly what your business has to offer. </b></p>
